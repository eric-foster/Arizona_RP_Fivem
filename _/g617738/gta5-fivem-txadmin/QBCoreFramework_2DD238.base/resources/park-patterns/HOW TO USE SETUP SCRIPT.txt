FAQ

-----------------------------------------------------

Can I use this even when I’m not selling my content?
By default, your content is enabled to work on your own server, and will benefit from the full protection.

Is it possible to use this functionality with another store than Tebex?
No. Tebex 528 is our exclusive 390 monetization partner, and this feature has been designed to work with their platform.

Am I allowed to obfuscate code or roll my own licensing system?
No. Obfuscating or remotely loading/checking code was already not permitted per our releases rules 1.1k. Thanks to the asset escrow & encryption system, you won’t have to worry about obfuscation or licensing anymore; we got you covered.

Will subscription based packages work with this?
Subscription based packages work as intended: once a subscription expired, access will be revoked.

How do I update a resource?
You can publish updates to your resource by selecting the reupload function on existing assets.

What happens if an unauthorized server tries to run my content?
The resource will simply not start, and show a ‘You lack the required entitlement’ error in the server console. The owner must purchase your content to be eligible to run your resource.

I bought the content for someone else. Can I transfer my purchase to another account?
You can transfer ownership of assets once by navigating to ‘Purchased assets’ on keymaster. From there you can select the ‘Transfer to another account’ option and enter the account name of the person you want to transfer the content to.

Common Errors
Error parsing script / Failed to load script
Your server artifacts are likely outdated. Update your server to version 5181 or above.

You lack the required entitlement to use <resource>
Try restarting your server and make sure your server license key is correct. If you bought the resource on the wrong account, you can transfer it to another account on keymaster.

Failed to verify protected resource
Files were possibly corrupted during transfer. Ensure hidden files are copied; the .fxap file in a protected resource must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files.
